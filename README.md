Explanation to the analysis file (run_analysis.R)

==================================================================

(1) The folowing datasets had to be used to be merged to one data set:

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.


(2) Only columns for mean() and standard deviations are extracted

(3) Descriptive activity names are given to the activities in the data set (by merging activity_labels.txt)

(4) Appropriate labels were given in each step

(5) Creating a second, independent tidy data set averaging each variable for each activity AND subject
